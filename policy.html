            for reasons other than illness, please discuss it with me ahead of time to get my permission. Class

            <strong>Grading policy</strong>: Homework and final project should be finished and turned in on time. Late

            no more than 3 days extension throughout the semester. Minimum unit is 1-day, you can use 1 day for three of
            five homework or, 3-day altogether on a single homework, at your own discretion.
            No make-up exams will be given.

        <p>
            <strong>Academic honesty</strong>: Discussions on course materials, homework questions and programming
            projects are encouraged. It is permissible to get help on debugging and to make use of public accessible
            programming
            libraries for your programming assignments. However, you should NOT ask any other person to write code for
            you. On your project report, you should specify from whom you received help and cite the references and
            software used. All homework solutions, code and report for programming projects should be finished
            individually.
